How to run the program:
	1) install pyperclip
		pip3 install pyperclip
	2) Write the whole text you want to send, in a file named "file.txt",
		be sure to put it in the same directory.
	
	3) python main.py
	
	press ENTER and the tweets will be copied to your clipboard.
	Do it until the program ends.

	
	ISSUES:
	
	If you encountered with unicodedecodeerror, it might be because of the enviornment you
	are running the program with.
	
	For example the program ran successfuly in Bash(Windows), but failed in POWERSHELL.
	I might try to fix that problem to make the code more portable later.
